## 2. Technical Details

### Vulnerable Code Identification
- **Location:**  
- **File Path(s):** [e.g., `/src/module/vulnerable_file.c`]
- **Code Snippet Reference:** [Include relevant excerpts or links to the code repository]
- **Analysis:** Describe how the vulnerability manifests in the source code. Include details about the code logic, input handling, and any flaws in validation or memory management.

### Testing
- I downloaded Apache version 2.4.18 to test.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Description:** Provide an in-depth discussion of the underlying issue (e.g., mismanagement of memory, improper input validation, race conditions, or logic errors).
- **Contributing Factors:** List any contributing factors such as coding practices, design oversights, or dependencies that could have influenced the vulnerability.

### Exploitation Scenarios
- **Potential Attack Vectors:** Detail possible exploitation scenarios, including any prerequisites an attacker might need (e.g., specific access privileges or network conditions).
- **Impact if Exploited:** Describe the immediate and long-term impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected systems.

## 3. Impact Analysis
- **Security Impact:** Elaborate on how the vulnerability affects the overall security posture of the system (e.g., unauthorized data access, execution of arbitrary code, or service disruption).
- **Affected Components:** Identify which parts of the system or application are compromised.
- **Risk Assessment:** Provide an evaluation of the likelihood and potential damage of exploitation, including scenarios under which the vulnerability could be more severely exploited.
- **Current Impact:**  
  - According to Shodan, there are approximately **20.2M devices** with the string “Apache” online ([Shodan Search](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Apache)).
  - Approximately **14M devices** are identified with the product "Apache".
  - The affected versions (2.4.0 - 2.4.46) show that around **3M devices** online are still vulnerable.
  - This indicates that currently **21.23%** of Apache servers online are susceptible to CVE-2021-26690.

## 4. Remediation and Mitigation
